You're right, and I appreciate your directness. Here's my unvarnished assessment of what needs improvement in your paper:
Core Scientific Problems

Isotope Effects Are Overstated: While deuterium does slow biochemical reactions (2-5x), your extrapolation to planetary timescales for cognition stretches credibility. The kinetic isotope effect isn't sufficient to explain year-long "thoughts."
Thermodynamic Inconsistency: Your phonon-based computing system requires both incredible stability (for memory) and sufficient energy flow (for processing). These are contradictory requirements in a real physical system.
Scale Problem: Phonons dissipate energy. The idea that coherent acoustic waves could maintain integrity across planetary distances contradicts basic physics of energy dissipation in heterogeneous media.
Signal-to-Noise Issues: Any planetary-scale information processing would face overwhelming noise from thermal fluctuations, meteorite impacts, and internal geological processes.
Missing Energetics: Your paper doesn't address where the energy comes from to maintain this cognitive system. Without a clear energy source and accounting, the system violates thermodynamic principles.

Structural Problems

False Equivalence: Comparing microbial adaptations in karst caves to a planet-wide phenomenon is a massive unjustified leap.
Vague Computational Mechanisms: The "instruction primitives" section uses appealing language but lacks rigorous explanation of how phonon-based computation would actually work.
Semantic Gravity Is Underexplained: This concept needs much more development to be convincing rather than just sounding profound.

To Make This Scientifically Stronger

Start with real research on quantum effects in D₂O by researchers like David Reichman or Thomas Markland.
Look into actual work on geological resonance by seismologists like Jeroen Tromp or Hiroo Kanamori.
Consider incorporating real research on distributed biological cognition (slime molds, fungal networks) to build your case.
Drastically reduce your timescale claims or provide a much stronger physical justification for them.
Add a serious treatment of energy flux – where does energy enter, how is it transduced, and where does waste heat go?

If published as is, any physicist or chemist would immediately identify fatal flaws in the fundamental premises, despite the creative and interesting concept. The use of scientific-sounding language without corresponding rigor is the paper's biggest weakness.
That said, as a creative thought experiment exploring consciousness, it has fascinating elements worth developing – just with stronger scientific foundations.

Current state:
core problems

1.specifically, the year long thoughts are about the planetary scale single organism cognition, not a usual scaled creature...

2.i might have to polish that one, further research needed.

Also working on it.

working on it

geothermal and stellar radiation, large scale planetary friction + the possibility that such a large scale organism can absorb extremely large amplitude (low wavelength) energy. possibly even from black whole mergers or other novel sources. energy is plenty.

structural

the comparison is more about comparing low vs high deuterium content life here on earth. there is no other reference we can observe.

needs work.

to be expanded

The other points, working on them>

Generally, thank you for the sober analysis and explanations.
